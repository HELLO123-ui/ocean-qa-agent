UI/UX Guidelines for E-Shop Checkout

1. Validation & Error States
- Form validation errors must be displayed as inline text directly under the field.
- Validation error text must be in RED (#f97373).
- If the discount code is invalid, show an inline error message under the discount input.
- If the payment method is invalid (e.g., PayPal with low order value), show an inline error near the Pay button.

2. Buttons & Primary Actions
- The "Pay Now" button must be GREEN (#22c55e) with white or dark text.
- Secondary actions such as "Apply" for the discount code can use neutral gray styling.

3. Layout & Structure
- The page is a single-column layout with a two-column content grid:
  - Left: Cart items + discount + totals.
  - Right: User details, shipping options, payment options, and Pay button.
- Inline labels should be placed above their corresponding input fields.

4. Messaging
- On successful payment, the message "Payment Successful!" must be clearly visible.
- On failure, show meaningful error messages instead of generic "Error" alerts.

5. Accessibility
- All interactive elements should have clear labels.
- Radio buttons for shipping and payment must be grouped and labelled appropriately.
